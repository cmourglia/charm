Charm is a language primary developed for learning purposes.

Starting as a simple and basic interpreted language (greatly inspired from lox
from https://craftinginterpreters.com).

Hopefully at some point it will end-up being compiled to machine code with a runtime
(a la go or dart).

The ultimate goal of this language would be to provide a platform to build native applications in a declarative manner,
a bit like QML, but compiled to machine code, and integrated with a more convenient language to work with for
application development than C++.
